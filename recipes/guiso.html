  <h1>Guiso recipe</h1>
  <img src="../img/guiso.jpg">
  <p>Guiso is a Spanish meat dish prepared by roasting or frying combined with braising. It is typically a hot, mildly fatty food. Unlike stew, it allows the vapors to circulate during culinary process.[1] In making guiso, a wide variety of ingredients may be used relative to region, season, availability, and taste.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>1 links chorizo sausage</li>
      <li>½ tablespoon and ½ teaspoon olive oil</li>
      <li>½ pounds cubed beef chuck roast</li>
      <li>⅓ onion, diced</li>
      <li>⅓ leek, white part only, chopped</li>
      <li>1 ⅓ cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>⅔ cup diced butternut squash</li>
      <li>⅔ potatoes, diced, or more to taste</li>
      <li>⅔ carrots, diced</li>
      <li>1 cups water, or as needed</li>
      <li>⅓ (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
      <li>⅓ cube vegetable bouillon</li>
      <li>1 teaspoons ground oregano</li>
      <li>⅓ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>⅔ cup ditalini pasta</li>
      <li>¼ cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoons frozen peas, thawed</li>
      <li>¼ cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoons cooked lentils</li>
      <li>2 ½ tablespoons and ½ teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>

  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
      <li>Place chorizo in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook, turning occasionally and pricking each link with a fork to release some of the fat, until browned, <strong>4 to 5 minutes</strong>. Remove sausages and slice when cool enough to handle. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a large pot over high heat. Add beef and cook until browned, <strong>3 to 4 minutes</strong>. Add reserved sausage slices, onion, leek, and garlic and saute until onion is translucent, about <strong>3 minutes</strong>. Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in butternut squash, potatoes, and carrots. Add water and tomato sauce. If vegetables are not covered with liquid, add more water to cover.</li>
      <li>Add bouillon cube, oregano, cumin, salt, and pepper and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until stew thickens up, about 1 hour. Add pasta, peas, lentils, and parsley. Cook until pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, <strong>8 to 10 minutes</strong>. You may need to add more water at this point, since the pasta will absorb liquid and the stew may become too dry.</li>
  </ol>
