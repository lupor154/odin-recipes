    <h1>Ravioli recipe</h1>
    <img src="../img/ravioli.jpg">
    <p>Ravioli are a type of pasta comprising a filling enveloped in thin pasta dough. Usually served in broth or with a sauce, they originated as a traditional food in Italian cuisine. Ravioli are commonly square, though other forms are also used, including circular and semi-circular (mezzelune).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup mashed, cooked butternut squash</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup mascarpone cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package round wonton wrappers</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, unpeeled</li>
        <li>chopped fresh sage to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste</li>
  
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place cooked squash into a mixing bowl. Add salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Stir in mascarpone cheese, egg yolk, and 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese, mixing until the filling is smoothly combined.</li>
        <li>Place a wonton wrapper onto a working surface. Wet the tip of a finger in water, and run it all along the outer edge of the wonton skin to moisten. Place about 1 teaspoon of filling in the center of the wonton. Fold the wonton in half to make a half-moon shape, and press the edges to seal. Repeat with the remaining wonton wrappers.</li>
        <li>Place a deep skillet over medium-low heat. Stir in butter and unpeeled clove of garlic. Meanwhile, bring a saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Drop the filled raviolis into the boiling water, a few at a time, and cook until they float to the top, about 2 minutes. Drain the raviolis, and transfer them to the skillet. Turn the heat under the skillet up to medium-high, and cook just until the raviolis are infused with garlic flavor, about 2 or 3 more minutes. Sprinkle with chopped sage, more black pepper, and extra Parmesan cheese to taste.</li>
    </ol>
